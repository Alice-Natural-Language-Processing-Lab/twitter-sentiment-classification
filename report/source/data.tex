The dataset we use to train and test our classifiers is the one provided for the EPFL Machine Learning text classification challenge on Kaggle\cite{KaggleEPFL}.
The dataset consists of two small sets of training tweets for each of the two classes\footnote{Positive/negative sentiment associated to the tweet.} (100,000 tweets each), two complete sets of training tweets for each of the two classes (1.25M tweets per class) and a test set (10,000 tweets).
