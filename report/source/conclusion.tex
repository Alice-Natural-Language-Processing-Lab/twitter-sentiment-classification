In this report, we described and compared several sentiment classifiers optimized towards predicting the sentiment polarity of tweets. 
Our approach is based on simple classification scheme in contrast to highly complex Neural Networks and therefore computationally quite cheap.
Though it relies on a large amount of training data.
After pre-processing, feature engineering and classifier optimization we were able to build a sentiment analyzer trained in a moderate time window while holding a good performance in terms of accuracy.
