Social media platforms such as Twitter are a rich source of text examples expressing positive and negative sentiment. 
In this paper, we investigate the classification accuracy achieved by different learning algorithms in determining sentiments associated to tweets.
Through data pre-processing and hyperparameter tuning, we report our computationally light TF-IDF Logistic Regression model, scoring 87.00 $\%$ accuracy in the EPFL ML Text classification challenge on Kaggle.
