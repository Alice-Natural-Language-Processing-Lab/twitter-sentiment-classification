# ML Project 2: DATA
This folder contains the [Twitter data files from Kaggle](https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/epfml-text/data) used for training and testing.<br>
## File descriptions
- `train_pos.txt` and `train_neg.txt` - a small set of training tweets for each of the two classes.
- `train_pos_full.txt` and `train_neg_full.txt` - a complete set of training tweets for each of the two classes, about 1M tweets per class. 
- `test_data.txt` - the test set, that is the tweets for which to predict the sentiment label.

All tweets have been tokenized already, so that the words and punctuation are properly separated by a whitespace.
